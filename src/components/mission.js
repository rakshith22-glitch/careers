      Building Qvin, we made it our mission to close this medical gender gap.
      <br />
      <br />
      Creating a healthcare system that is more enlightened to our differences,
      so women can achieve a more equitable level of care.
      <br /> <br />
      Qvin : [ Kvin ] <br />
      <br />
      Our unique name speaks to this mission. It’s crafted in honor of our
      heritage—and you. As a company founded by two Danes, Qvin (pronounced
      Kvin) is a variation on the Danish word for women.
      <br />
      <br /> Women being the catalyst for everything we, as a company, pursue.
